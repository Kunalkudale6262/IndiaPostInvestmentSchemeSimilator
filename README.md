India Post Investment Scheme Simulator

This Java-based desktop application is designed to simulate and compare various investment schemes offered by India Post.

returns on investment in a simple and interactive way.

Simulates popular India Post schemes:
Recurring Deposit (RD)
Public Provident Fund (PPF)
Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS)
Monthly Income Scheme (MIS)
National Savings Certificate (NSC)
Time Deposit (TD)

Key Features:

Motivation:
This project was developed while working at India Post in a rural village, where many people lacked awareness and confidence in investing. The simulator was built to bridge this gap â€” making it easier for both postal staff and villagers to visualize returns and understand the benefits of government-backed schemes.
